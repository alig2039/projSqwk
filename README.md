Squawk is a Social Network that allows for posting, replying and re-broadcast of posts. A social feed is created for every user and Users can follow others. 

The User acceptance criteria is for users to be able to post, reply, follow another user to see their posts on a social feed and re-broadcast another user's posts

The system uses a React front end with a Django Rest Framework backend.
The back end repository can be found [here](https://github.com/alig2039/project5_squawk_front)
